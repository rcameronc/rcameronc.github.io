        <!--My work broadly concerns philosophy of machine learning, ethics of AI, and general philosophy of science.  I am interested in how humans can best use computation to understand themselves and their world.  How can we gain scientific understanding with opaque, black-box computational methods? What ways of explaining machine learning best serve scientific and public life?  How should supposedly autonomously generated concepts inspire us to revise our own?  In answering these sorts of questions, I connect traditional topics in philosophy of science such as explanation, reference, and natural kinds with a practice-based approach to the study of methods in contemporary machine learning. By examining these epistemic and normative questions, I outline more fruitful uses of machine learning for human flourishing.

         My research explores the moral and political philosophy of uses of machine learning in public life, and the epistemology of machine learning in science. In current uses of machine learning, powerful mathematical tools promise to expand human cognitive capacities, but threaten to endanger epistemic and moral goods while doing so. I formulate theories of transparency and explanation in machine learning and use them to address ethical, political, and scientific problems in machine learningâ€™s current applications. -->

            Understanding the behavior of Earth's ice sheets during the Holocene
            (~11.7 thousand years ago to present) helps us place climate warming due to human activities
            in the context of natural climate variability. Mounting field evidence
            from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets indicates that both ice sheets retreated past their present extents
            over the last 10,000 years, then readvanced to the present.
            By contrast, standard global ice sheet reconstructions model global
            mean sea level as reaching present-levels between 3 and 6 thousand
            years ago and remaining there until the pre-industrial.  Using an
            ensemble of glacial isostatic adjustment models and a large
            collection of relative sea level (RSL) data, I show that
            global mean sea level (GMSL) likely exceeded present levels during the
            mid-Holocene.  I also find that regardless of emissions scenario,
            GMSL by 2100 will be higher than at any time in
            more than 100,000 years.

           <!-- Deep neural networks are often thought to be opaque black boxes. However, the sense in which they are opaque is philosophically interesting since every component of the system can be individually surveyed.  What would it mean for such a sytem to be transparent? Is transparency required for trust? I explore explanatory strategies for opaque machine learning both as it is used for science and as it is used in public life.  For an example of this work see my paper on <a href="#transparency">transparency</a> below.
            <br>
        I am also interested in how machine learning influences scientific and social categories. When new features crosscut our existing scientific or social categories, how do we or should we revise our understanding of the world and its contents?

        <p>
            Subsea permafrost, which is perennially cryotic sediment lying below
            sea level, forms when rising seas flood
            terrestrial permafrost on the Arctic continental shelf. Understanding
            subsea permafrost is important because it contains vast amounts of carbon,
            which, if released, could enter the atmosphere as greenhouse gasses.
            RSL variations control subsea permafrost stability, yet no existing
            subsea permafrost model includes RSL. I address this deficit by adding
            GIA into a model of pan-Arctic subsea permafrost for the last 400,000 years.
            This model enables me and my colleagues to estimate present-day subsea
            permafrost extent, then extend the simulation ~1000 years into the
            future to quantify how much subsea permafrost will thaw with high emissions.


           <!-- Answers to epistemic questions about transparency and explanation are relevant to the use of algorithmic decision making in public life. I consider case studies of non-state use of automated decision-making, such as automated hiring systems and loan approval algorithms. What implications do adversarial examples and other known features of deep learning systems have for transparency and fairness? <a href="#leviathan">A paper from this project </a> has been accepted at <b style="color:rgb(88, 88, 88)"><a href='https://facctconference.org/2021/acceptedpapers.html'>ACM FAccT 2021.</a></b>
        <br>

        Whether or not these systems are black boxes, if they are treated as such we may come to trust them on a testimonial basis.  I explore questions of machine testimony and of appropriate trust in automated decisionmaking systems.
<!--
Drawing on contemporary pragmatists like Elizabeth Anderson, I propose an explanatory framework for algorithmic decisions made in public life that respects the multiplicity of explanatory purposes.  Although an applicant may first be interested in the reasons for a loan's denial, upon learning more about the system she might come to be interested in whether protected features such as race were used in the making the decision and whether the decision-making system as a whole is unjust.  A pragmatist account of meaning for purpose allows us to provide reasons that shift with the epistemic goals of the users. -->

            RSL patterns near ice sheets can open a valuable window into
            the interplay of ice sheet melt and local solid earth effects.
            Norway is singular for having detailed sea level records extending
            nearly 20,000 years into the past.  We collect and quality-control 1000
            RSL observations from the Norwegian coastline, then use an
            ensemble of Bayesian statistical models to assess spatiotemporal
            patterns of Norwegian RSL change.
