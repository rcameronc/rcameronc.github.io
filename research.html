            Understanding the behavior of Earth's ice sheets during the Holocene
            (~11.7 thousand years ago to present) helps us place climate warming due to human activities
            in the context of natural climate variability. Mounting field evidence
            from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets indicates that both ice sheets retreated past their present extents
            over the last 10,000 years, then readvanced to the present.
            By contrast, standard global ice sheet reconstructions model global
            mean sea level as reaching present-levels between 3 and 6 thousand
            years ago and remaining there until the pre-industrial.  Using an
            ensemble of glacial isostatic adjustment models and a large
            collection of relative sea level (RSL) data, I show that
            global mean sea level (GMSL) likely exceeded present levels during the
            mid-Holocene.  I also find that regardless of emissions scenario,
            GMSL by 2100 will be higher than at any time in
            more than 100,000 years.

        <p>
            Subsea permafrost, which is perennially cryotic sediment lying below
            sea level, forms when rising seas flood
            terrestrial permafrost on the Arctic continental shelf. Understanding
            subsea permafrost is important because it contains vast amounts of carbon,
            which, if released, could enter the atmosphere as greenhouse gasses.
            RSL variations control subsea permafrost stability, yet no existing
            subsea permafrost model includes glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA).
            I address this deficit by adding
            GIA into a model of pan-Arctic subsea permafrost for the last 400,000 years.
            This model enables me and my colleagues to estimate present-day subsea
            permafrost extent, then extend the simulation ~1000 years into the
            future to quantify how much subsea permafrost will thaw with high emissions.

            RSL patterns near ice sheets can open a valuable window into
            the interplay of ice sheet melt and local solid earth effects.
            Norway is singular for having detailed sea level records extending
            nearly 20,000 years into the past.  We collect and quality-control 1000
            RSL observations from the Norwegian coastline, then use an
            ensemble of Bayesian statistical models to assess spatiotemporal
            patterns of Norwegian RSL change.

            Interest in the mathematical foundations of Bayesian modeling led me to
            collaborate on two papers with Professor William Menke at Columbia.
            Our first paper explores Gaussian process regression, a powerful Bayesian
            modeling technique and staple of machine learning, through the lens of
            geophysical inverse theory.  Our second explains what makes differential
            data attractive, when they should not be used, and the situations to
            which they are well suited.
        </p>
            <p>The papers together have important practical applications and
                are ripe for interdisciplinary application.  For example,
                we can pinpoint where more observations of ancient—or modern—sea
                level would most improve existing models.  Our tool helps researchers
                planning expensive field work prioritize locations from which
                additional data would most benefit communities in making
                sea-level mitigation decisions.

        <p>

        Global mean sea level (GMSL) during the last interglacial (LIG, 130 – 115
         thousand years ago) period was higher than present, likely because more
        sunlight hit Earth’s high latitudes. Estimates of LIG sea-level require
        measuring the elevation and age of sediments or organisms that formed
        near sea level.  Those measurements must be corrected for the
        gravitational, rotational, and deformational effects of water loading of the
         solid Earth, together termed glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA).  Uncertainty
        about Earth’s rheology and past ice history undermine this GIA correction,
        and, by extension, LIG GMSL estimates.  We address this challenge by
        comparing LIG sea-level data from the Lucayan archipelago and
        stratigraphic information gathered during fieldwork to a large ensemble
        of GIA predictions within a Bayesian statistical framework.  Our posterior
        LIG GMSL curves are lower than many previous estimates, suggesting that
        the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be less vulnerable to future collapse.

            The Ordovician-Silurian glaciation (450 – 380 million years ago) marked
            the first ice sheet collapse of the Phanerozoic era. Understanding how ice
            sheets could have survived in a world with atmospheric CO2
            concentrations twenty times present levels requires analysis of that
            period’s sedimentary rocks.  I applied petrographic, chemostratigraphic,
            and trace-elemental analysis to Ordovician-Silurian carbonates to
            determine that they recorded contemporaneous climate signals despite
            significant post-depositional alteration.  I also contributed to a study that
            used clumped isotope measurements of calcitic and phosphatic marine
            fossils to measure Ordovician tropical sea surface temperatures and
            seawater oxygen isotope ratios.
